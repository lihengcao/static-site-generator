I like this [blog post](https://amid.fish/getting-better-at-scary-things) about "getting better at scary things."

## Note to self
I want to separate these link posts from other posts since link posts will be much shorter. I'm using a theme, so the control isn't there. I think the best solution is to either [copy the theme's files](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/adding-a-theme-to-your-github-pages-site-using-jekyll#customizing-your-themes-html-layout) and edit them, or just create my own minimal theme that draws heavily from the theme. Maybe something really simple like [my personal site](https://lihengcao.github.io). If that happens, it might make sense to migrate that site to Jekyll.
