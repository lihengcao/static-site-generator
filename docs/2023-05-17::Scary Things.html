<h1>Scary Things</h1>
<p>Date: 2023-05-17</p>
<p>I like this <a href="https://amid.fish/getting-better-at-scary-things">blog post</a> about "getting better at scary things."</p>
<h2>Note to self</h2>
<p>I want to separate these link posts from other posts since link posts will be much shorter. I'm using a theme, so the control isn't there. I think the best solution is to either <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/adding-a-theme-to-your-github-pages-site-using-jekyll#customizing-your-themes-html-layout">copy the theme's files</a> and edit them, or just create my own minimal theme that draws heavily from the theme. Maybe something really simple like <a href="https://lihengcao.github.io">my personal site</a>. If that happens, it might make sense to migrate that site to Jekyll.</p>
